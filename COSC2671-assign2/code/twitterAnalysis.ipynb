    "When one thinks about Australia many beautiful things might come to your mind. The Sydney Opera House, the Uluru, or maybe the Skyline of Melbourne to name just three examples. However, besides the world on land, there is a second world: The underwater world. And Australia can be proud of having the world's largest coral reef, the Great Barrier Reef (= GBR), as part of its coastline in Queensland. The reef is 2.300 km long, it is a natural world wonder and it consists of over 3000 individual reef systems [(1)](https://cairnsdiveadventures.com.au/reef-info/where-is-the-great-barrier-reef-located/) [(2)](https://greatbarrierreef.org/). It is interesting to analyze this topic to find out what various topics the Great Barrier Reef might cover. Therefore, the main task of this analysis is to find out which topics that are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before my analysis, I expected that tourism with hotels and boat trips would be a large part of the data. I could also imagine that comparisons of the different reefs (naming the most well-known ones) might be a part of it. It turned out, that these expectations only partly meet the actual Twitter data."

    "For my analysis, I downloaded the Twitter data for one week (ranging from the 2nd of August 2022 to 9th of August 2022) for the search query '\"Great Barrier Reef\" lang:en'. The query ensures with the usage of '\"', that the words 'Great', 'Barrier' and 'Reef' are not only contained in the requested posts but are also in this order contained and the addition 'lang:en' ensures, that only English posts are downloaded. I decided to use only English posts for the reasons of understandability and because the data is enough.\n",

I decided on the restful API because the data of one week is more than sufficient for this analysis, and because it is not the goal of this report to get real-time (or close to real-time) insights about data but to analyze data of a certain timeframe in the past.\n",

Therewith, it is possible to gain access to all other public fields again without downloading the data again. That approach is efficient as for the download of one post it does not matter how many fields are included, it will count as one download to the Twitter rest API limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is based on the text, entities (for hashtags), and created_at fields. Those are the only ones required content-wise. Additionally, I decided to not remove the id, because therewith it is possible to get access to all the data for one specific post again by comparing the ids.\n",
    "I also filtered that each tweet should contain \"great barrier reef\" (not case-sensitive) as a part of the text, and I eliminated duplicated tweets that contain exactly the same text as another tweet. I limited the number of tweets to 5000 to not exceed the file size limit of 5 MB.\n",

    "4. Stemming\n",
    "5. Removal of stopwords, punctuation, digits, and Twitter specific strings\n",

    "The conversion to lowercase makes sure that uppercase and lowercase letters are processed the same way. Writing upper- or lowercase letters is relevant for the syntax of the sentence but very little for the semantics. As we are interested in the content we can ignore the upper- and lowercase spelling by converting everything to lowercase.\n",
    "Tokenization is the process of splitting text into words. To further process the text, this is relevant for our analysis.\n",
    "Stripping is the process of removing whitespaces at the beginning and the end. Therewith our words now only contain the actual words.\n",
    "Stemming removes the grammatical context of the words and reduces words to their word stem. Therewith words are reduced to their meaning regardless of the grammatical structure of the sentence. For content analysis, this is what we want to achieve.\n",

    "## Analysis Approach - TODO\n",
    "To answer the question of what the GBR is about on Twitter, I did mainly three different approaches. I decided to start with word and hashtag analysis, then I did sentiment analysis and at last, I did some topic analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of the analysis, the very simple word and hashtag analysis, is done to get an overview over the topic on Twitter. Additionally, the results of this first part might give us some help for later hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next part of this report is about sentiment analysis which will be used to understand the feelings (positive or negative sentiment) about the Great Barrier Reef. I considered the scoring based and the Vader approach with and without preprocessing for this report. The count method labels each tweet either positive or negative or neutral. It uses a dictionary with positive associated and a dictionary with negative associated words. The vader method has two main advantages compared to this. Firstly, it considers multiple levels of positivity and negativity resulting in a value ranging from very positive to very negative. Secondly, it tries to consider negated positive words as negative and vice versa. In this report, both were tried out and one can switch between the different methods. The best results however were gained from the vader approach due to its more precise scoring and that is why it is the default approach used later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third and last part is the topic analysis. Here I decided on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) due to being a popular and unsupervised approach. LDA is a clustering model, that assumes that each document contains a certain number of topics. Each topic contains words and for each word, there is an assigned probability. It is the probability that the next chosen word out of this topic is the corresponding one. By choosing a number of topics the model is therewith able to generate a sequence of words that depend on the chosen topic and on the probability for each word to be next. By then comparing the generated text to the original text, calculating the difference, adjusting the probabilities, and repeating the model can do unsupervised training. After the training is finished the resulting model can then cluster the tweets to topics that defer from each other. Using this LDA model with a varying number of topics as hyperparameter input I clustered the tweets about the Great Barrier Reef into various topics."
